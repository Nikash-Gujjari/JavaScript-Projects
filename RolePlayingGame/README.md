**Objective:** The final goal of the game is to defeat the final boss, the dragon, which is accessible through the **Fight Dragon** option from the **Town Square**. Defeating the dragon means that players **Won** the game.
**Player Resources:** **Gold** allows players to purchase health and stronger weapons from the **Store**. Higher **XP** translates to more damage on hits with weapons on the monsters. **Gold** and **XP** are both obtained by defeating monsters.

**Combat**: When in combat with monsters, players can choose to **Attack**, **Dodge**, or **Run**. Attacking a monster gives a chance to damage the monster (there is a chance of missing). If the player attacks with a weapon other than the stick (default weapon), the weapon has a chance of breaking and forcing the player to use the next strongest weapon. Dodging lets the player dodge a single attack of the monster (subsequent dodges have no effect). Running lets the player escape combat to the Town Square (all health lost and weapons broken during combat are not given back).

**Death**: If the player's health reaches 0 in combat, the player dies. This counts as **Losing** the game. At this point, the player's only choice is to **Replay** the game, which restarts them to the beggining state of 0 **XP**, 100 **Health**, 50 **Gold** and only the stick weapon in the inventory.
